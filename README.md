# Discord bot

Just a simple discord bot for moderation made with node.js

## Installation

just type "npm install" on your terminal before launching it and when everything is installed type "node ." on the root directory.

## Usage
On /Validation/config.js put in token the discord api key and in database the mongoose key. Throughout the code put your server id on guild id and the channel id where you need the bot to act. The text is in italian because the bot was moderating an italian server, but you can change it to make it say whatever you want. "parolacce.json" contains the dictionary for the bad words and curses you wanna filter.
